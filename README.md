# Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM)
The provided code implements the Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM) for solving transportation problems, where the goal is to minimize the total transportation cost from several suppliers to several consumers, given their respective supply and demand quantities and the cost of transporting between each supplier and consumer.

### Function `calculate_difference`

- **Purpose:** Calculates the difference (referred to as the "penalty" in some explanations) between the two lowest costs in each row and column of the cost matrix. However, in this implementation, it's called "difference" to avoid confusion.
- **Implementation:** 
    - Iterates through each row to find the two smallest costs, calculates their difference, and stores these differences in `row_difference`.
    - Repeats a similar process for each column, storing the differences in `column_difference`.
    - If the smallest cost or the second smallest cost in a row or column is `np.inf`, indicating that the route is no longer viable for allocation, it sets the difference to `-1` to exclude it from consideration.

### Function `vogel_approximation_method`

- **Purpose:** Allocates supply to demand in a way that aims to minimize the total transportation cost, using the VAM approach.
- **Implementation:**
    - Initializes an allocation result matrix with the same shape as the cost matrix.
    - Continues allocation until the sum of all allocations equals the total demand.
    - In each iteration, it calculates the row and column differences using `calculate_difference`.
    - Determines whether to allocate based on row or column by comparing the maximum differences. It prioritizes the direction (row or column) with the higher maximum difference.
    - For the selected row or column, it sorts the costs to find the most cost-effective allocation.
    - Allocates the minimum of the available supply or demand to the selected supplier-consumer pair.
    - Updates the supply and demand arrays to reflect the allocation.
    - Marks all costs in the selected row or column as `np.inf` to indicate that no further allocation should be made along that row or column if either the supply is exhausted or the demand is fully met.
    - Repeats this process until there is no more demand to satisfy.

### Overall Process

The algorithm starts by calculating the difference (penalty) for each row and column, aiming to identify where allocating resources would make the most significant difference in minimizing additional costs. It then allocates supply to demand based on these differences, ensuring that each allocation is as cost-effective as possible given the current state of the problem. This process repeats until all demand is met, resulting in a transportation plan that, while not guaranteed to be perfectly optimal, is generally very efficient and close to the minimum possible cost.

The use of `np.inf` to mark used routes and the iterative comparison of differences are key aspects of this method, allowing it to dynamically adjust to the state of the transportation problem as allocations are made.
